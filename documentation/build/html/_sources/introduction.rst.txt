================
Physicians and practitioners unfortunately spend too much time manually entering data into an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system.
Our solution to this problem involves preserving the clarity and completeness that an EMR provides without
compromising physician efficiency and the patient experience. With our proprietary ARMR System
(Audio Recorded Medical Record), verbal dictation and machine learning interfaces with existing EMR
systems to capture data in a time-efficient and patient-centered fashion.
