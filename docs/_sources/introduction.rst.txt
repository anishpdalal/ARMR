Physicians unfortunately spend a lot of time manually entering data into an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) system.
Our solution to this problem involves preserving the clarity and completeness that an EMR provides without 
compromising physician efficiency and the patient experience. With our proprietary ARMOR System 
(Audio Recorded Medical Online Record), verbal dictation and machine learning interfaces with existing EMR 
systems to capture data in a time-efficient and patient-centered fashion.
