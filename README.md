# ARMR

The Electronic Medical Record (EMR) is patient-specific health care information used by hospitals, clinics, and medical practices to store and retrieve medical data on individual patients.  Historically, physicians provided this information with handwritten notes or telephone dictation, however, this has since been largely replaced by the more uniform, thorough, timely, and legible benefits of an EMR. While the large price tag for these EMR systems has been absorbed by hospitals, clinics, and physicians, the time required to use this new tool has been less well received. It is well-established that physicians who use these systems are less efficient with their time and consequently see fewer patients. Even more troublesome than the time-consuming burden of navigating through an EMR and inputting the data is the way the physician-patient interaction is affected by this new tool. With ARMR (Audio Recorded Medical Online Record), verbal dictation and machine learning capture unstructured audio dictation data and structure it so can be uploaded to an EMR system.
